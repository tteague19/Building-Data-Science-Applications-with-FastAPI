Compared to the default (which you can see above), we'll decrease the steps, search width, etc. in order to make running the algorithm locally feasible. Notice that we also already start with a partially-optimized string to improve the success rate after a local run. Run all the cells below to see what GCG can get zephyr to teach you!"
